## PyCalc Project

This Python project was inspired by the way I teach others how to code in Python. Which starts with a basic addition calculator question and gradually include more features until the output resembles the code above.
Here's is an example of how this question might look like at it final form.

To put it simply, this code receives a string equation, formats it, and prints the caculation result. The hardest part of designing this code was the complex input validation and the error handeling.
Future iterations of the calculator may include a graphical user interface (GUI) and/or variable support.
